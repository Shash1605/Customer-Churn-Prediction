# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifiers. The dataset includes customer demographic information, account details, and service usage patterns. Key features include customer ID, gender, age, partner status, dependents, tenure, and various service-related attributes. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The models are implemented in Python using libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms in identifying customers who are likely to churn, providing valuable insights for businesses to implement retention strategies.
